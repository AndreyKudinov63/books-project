# books-project

It is a project for my friend, who study in university and need some help with web development course.

[Demo](https://books-university-project.netlify.app/)

## Description

There are three roles:

- **Guest** can add to bookmarks (session storage);

- **User** can add bookmarks. Bookmarks save in AirTable. User can update nickname and avatar. New User is adding automatically when he sings in/up with login that there isn’t in AirTable;

- **Admin** can do the same things what can do user. Also he can add/remove books and users.

## Disadvantages
I've wanted to do it with Firebase. I worked a lot with Firebase, so after thinking, I've chosen AirTable like something new for me.
AirTable isn’t equal Firebase. It haven’t got any auth methods. So my auth is quite simple and doesn’t defend from hacks.

## Advanjedges
My design and animations look pretty interesting.
Also there is a good code base in the project.

## Peculiarity
I created this project for my friend, who doesn’t know JS as good as I want. So I didn’t use any frameworks, like React or Vue.
I understand with frameworks the project code base would be less a lot. But I think Vanilla JS is better for understanding that some framework.

## Feedback
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

## Todo
- add functionality for add/update/remove authors
- add logic to facet filter on home page
